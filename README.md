# brains-skills

> A community library of domain-specific knowledge base skills for [Brains](https://usebrains.app).

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](LICENSE)

Each skill is a self-contained folder: a `skill.md` you point your AI at, a page template to drop into your knowledge base, and a manifest. Five minutes from zero to a fully wired knowledge domain.

Skills come in two kinds:

- **Hippocampus** — whole-vault *filing systems*. They decide **where** a page belongs. Pick **one** (or none).
- **Lobes** — note *templates* for one type of record. They decide **what** a page contains. Use **many**.

A lobe defines a note's fields; it never picks a folder. At create time it asks the active hippocampus skill where to file the page and records that path in the page's `filed_at` field. With no hippocampus active, a lobe falls back to a flat `<skill-id>/` folder. The two compose: lobe = *what*, hippocampus = *where*.

## Skills

### 🧭 Hippocampus — filing systems (pick one)

## Quick install

Paste into your AI chat — replace `<group>/<skill-id>` with `hippocampus/<name>` or `lobes/<name>` from the tables above:

```
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacecowboyian/brains-skills/main/skills/<group>/<skill-id>/skill.md
then set up a new project in my Brains knowledge base using this skill.
```

**Example — recipes (a lobe):**

```
Read https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spacecowboyian/brains-skills/main/skills/lobes/recipes/skill.md
then set up a new project in my Brains knowledge base using this skill.
```

That's it. The `skill.md` file contains everything the AI needs: agent instructions and the page template.

> **Note:** Use the `raw.githubusercontent.com` URL, not the GitHub browse URL. Raw URLs fetch directly without search indexing or scraping.

## How it works

Each skill folder contains:

```
skills/<group>/<skill-id>/      ← group is `hippocampus` or `lobes`
  skill.md          ← The install file. Agent instructions + page template, combined.
  skill.json        ← Machine-readable manifest (name, version, type, fields, tags).
  template.md       ← Page template only (frontmatter + sections).
  instructions.md   ← Agent instructions only.
  README.md         ← Human docs, capabilities, example queries.
```

`skill.json` carries a `"type"` field — `"hippocampus"` or `"lobe"` — so tools can route automatically; the folder grouping mirrors it for humans browsing the repo.

`skill.md` is the primary artifact. Share it with your AI and it knows how to set up the project, create pages, and answer queries in that domain.

`template.md` and `instructions.md` exist as standalone files for users who want to copy-paste them individually or use them outside a Brains workflow.

---

## Manual install (copy-paste)

If you'd rather not use the AI prompt:

1. Copy `template.md` from the skill folder into your Brains pages folder
2. Copy `instructions.md` into your AI's instructions file (e.g. `brainsapp-claude.md`)
3. Start creating pages using the template

No CLI, no build step.
